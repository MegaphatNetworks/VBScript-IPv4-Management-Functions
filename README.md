# VBScript IPv4 Management Functions
 A small VBScript library for managing IPv4 addresses.

Short and simple, I got tired of having NO public scripts that allow me to perform INET_NTOA and check address ranges and subnets, so I made one.
I provided some samples in the code so to give you all a head start.
